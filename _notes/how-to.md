# Introduction
Hi! I'm Shreyas Segu - have spent nearly 3 years as a Software Engineer across various Orgs (Apttus, VTiger, Clarivate, Kenko Health). I have worked towards delivering high-quality products, platforms, and processes from scratch.

## Key Traits
- Forward-thinking.
- Very focused and hands-on Techie.
- Love knowledge sharing and tech discussions to solve problems.
- Love learning new stuff from you.
- Common sense engineering.

## Engineering Practices

> Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out - Chris Pine

- Spend 80% time sharpening the Axe and 20% time cutting the wood efficiently. Think about the problem in detail before jumping into solution-ing it.
- Clean and Functional Code.
- Cloud-Native Architecture.
- Always looking for ways to improve engineering productivity, TDD, Gitops, Automation, etc.
- I believe that Engineers should own all parts of the SDLC, Backend, Frontend, Infrastructure, QA, and DevOps.
- Don't re-invent the wheel, don't roll out your custom solutions where there is Industry-standard software that does it way better, and focus on solving problems for the customer first.

## Communication Style

- Always enforcing asynchronous communication, Do you always wonder if that meeting could have been an email?
- Please read and follow [[no-hello]]
- Got Stuck in solving some problem? Before reaching out for help 
  - make some rough notes on the different approaches you have tried 
  - and what was the outcome of those... 
- Transparent and Direct feedback mostly and I expect the same.
- Mostly up-to-date on reading my Email/Chat. Even FYI email as well. If anything needs my attention/response, do tag me explicitly. 
- For urgent things or business-critical issues, keywords like `sos`, `prod`, `production`, `down` get me notified.
- Have some questions bothering you during late night or early morning or any day, don't shy from posting a message about it. Will acknowledge or respond whenever I will be around.
- Me cross-questioning doesn't mean that something is wrong, it means I'm more interested to understand the rationale behind it as well.

## Acronyms

| FYI & A | For Your Information and Action |
| LGTM    | Looks Good To Me                |
| TBD     | To Be Decided                   |

## My Philosophies
- Beautiful work is better than ugly work.
- Readability counts (code, documentation, commit messages, DMs).
- Explicit communication is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex and Complex is better than complicated.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Trust the process, and stick to it.
