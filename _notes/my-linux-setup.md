# My Development setup on Linux
Linux is one of the most versatile operating systems ever made, over the years I've worked on Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions, and by far the experience on Linux is the best one I've had.

## Preface
Just like most people, I started tinkering with my PC on Windows, starting with Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows 7,8,10. I didn't know anything but windows and I had assumed that nothing could beat windows (even though I broke my PC more times than I can care to admit)

And when I started to program more seriously, the first thing that drew me to Linux was the Gitbash terminal on Windows. The experience using Gitbash when compared to the command prompt / powershell was night and day. Everything on the Linux terminal makes more sense compared to cmd.

I transitioned to macOS while working and then completely fell in love with the UNIX style terminal experience. Even though the tweaks that I could do to macOS were lackluster compared to windows, there was no going back.

When I moved on to my next job, I was given a windows laptop, oh the horror! The ram usage when opening vs-code with nothing else running was around 50% of my 16 gigs. This is what led me to explore Linux much more deeply, although I had used a lot of different distros (ubuntu, popOS, elementary OS, manjaro) during my college days, it was an amateur attempt at trying to daily drive Linux, I didn't know what I was doing. However, this time things were different, I had to make this work for my day job.

## Phases of exploration
I started to use the old, trusty Ubuntu, what could go wrong? No problems with Ubuntu however the desktop environment (gnome) was lackluster after being used to macOS and Windows. I used it for a couple of months and as I was researching more and more about how to make my development workflow seamless, I came across Window Managers

Window Managers are game-changers! If you want to increase your productivity and if you want to tailor your Linux experience to exactly how you like it, there's no better way than to use a Window Manager, this led me down a rabbit hole of installing more tools that customize my experience.

## Current Setup
I now daily-drive these tools for my work
- Fedora 37
- Kitty Terminal
- zsh
- i3 Window Manager
- Rofi Application Launcher
- Polybar for the bar
- Neovim / VS Code

## Benefits
- Everything is Keyboard driven
- A couple of key bindings will open my most used applications
- Unlimited workspaces
- No need of dragging windows, resizing it, yada yada, everything will always be in place
- Theming is limitless, I use the same theme for all my applications, and it's very cohesive
